<p>The Typeahead is basically a component which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>takes a user input as a string</li>
  <li>pipes this input to an Observable chain to get a list of options</li>
  <li>handles the display of the popup containing the options</li>
  <li>handles the navigation through and the selection of options</li>
</ul>

<p>Graphically it's a combination of: </p>

<ul>
  <li>an input used to edit the search term and to display the selected option</li>
  <li>a popup containing the list of options</li>
</ul>

<p>The Typeahead is basically a component which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>takes a user input</li>
  <li>pipes this input to an Observable chain to get a list of options</li>
  <li>handles the popup of options and option selection</li>
</ul>

<p>Graphically it's a combination of an input and a popup containing a list.</p>

<p>Let's introduce some concepts: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the <span class="definition">search term</span>: a string used as input to produce a <span class="defined">results list</span></li>
  <li>the <span class="definition">results list</span> and the <span class="definition">result item</span>: the list given to the Typeahead for display; goes through formatting before to be converted to an <span class="defined">options list</span> for display</li>
  <li>the <span class="definition">options list</span> and the <span class="definition">option item</span>: the list displayed by the Typeahead in its attached <span class="defined">popup</span>, corresponding 1 by 1 to the <span class="defined">results list</span></li>
  <li>the <span class="definition">input field</span>: holds a formatted representation of the currently selected <span class="defined">result item</span> if any, and allows editing the <span class="defined">search term</span></li>
  <li>the <span class="definition">popup</span>: the popup attached to the <span class="defined">input field</span> and displaying the <span class="defined">options list</span></li>
</ul>

<!-- <p>
 TODO: make a diagram pointing out each parts (including the popup, the input, etc. but also what is data model and what is display)
</p> -->

<p>
  For the sake of the demos, the Typeahead instances will filter out a basic list of colors, keeping only the ones starting with the <span class="defined">search term</span>.

<p>The Typeahead is basically a component which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>takes a user input</li>
  <li>pipes this input to an Observable chain to get a list of options</li>
  <li>handles the popup of options and option selection</li>
</ul>
<p>Graphically it's a combination of an input and a popup containing a list.</p>
